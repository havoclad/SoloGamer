## Technical Implementation Notes

### ✅ Successfully Implemented Patterns

**Complex Roll Tables**: `G-3.json` demonstrates 2d6 roll ranges (e.g., "24,25", "42-44")
```json
"42-44": {
  "Target": "St. Nazaire",
  "notes": [{"table": "O-2", "modifier": "1"}]
}
```

**Conditional Tables**: `G-4a.json` shows OnlyIfRollTable pattern
```json
"variable_to_test": "mission",
"test_criteria": ">", 
"test_against": "5"
```

**Table Modifiers**: Multiple tables reference modifier systems
```json
"notes": [{"table": "O-2", "why": "Increased flak", "modifier": "1"}]
```

**Multi-Roll Tables**: `O-3.json` demonstrates grouped rolling
```json
"table_count": "3",
"group_by": "sum"
```

### 🔧 Implementation Considerations

**Fighter Combat System Complexity**:
- Requires position-based combat (nose, tail, high, low attacks)
- Multiple fighter types with different capabilities  
- Formation position affects both attack and defense
- Crew position affects defensive fire capability

**Damage System Integration**:
- Each aircraft section needs detailed damage effects
- Cumulative damage affects multiple systems
- Some damage affects subsequent table rolls

**Variable System Dependencies**:
- Many tables depend on game state variables
- Need mission number, target, formation position, crew status
- Weather and damage states affect multiple table outcomes

## Development Notes

### File Naming Convention
- `FLOW-*.json`: Game flow sequences
- `G-*.json`: General game tables (missions, positions, etc.)
- `O-*.json`: Operational tables (weather, combat, bombing)
- `B-*.json`: Fighter combat tables *(to be implemented)*
- `D-*.json`: Damage system tables *(to be implemented)*
- `C-*.json`: Crew management tables *(to be implemented)*
- `N-*.json`: Navigation system tables *(to be implemented)*

### JSON Structure Standards
All tables follow the SoloGamer engine patterns:
- `table_type`: "roll", "onlyif", "flow"  
- `rolltype`: Dice specification ("d6", "2d6", "d6d6")
- `rolls`: Results keyed by roll values or ranges
- `determines`: Variable name set by table result
- `notes`: Cross-references and modifiers

### Testing Commands
```bash
./build.bash                    # Rebuild after table changes
./run.bash --automated --debug  # Test full mission with debug output
./test.bash                     # Run unit tests
```
