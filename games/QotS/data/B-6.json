    "Any fighter which scores a hit in its initial attack (even if the hit has no effect) attacks the B-17 again.",
    "After all fighters conducting successive attacks are positioned, remove the number of fighters allowed due to successful fighter cover according to the roll on Table M-4 during the initial attack.",
    "Fighters which score a hit during their first successive attack conduct a second successive attack.",
    "After its second successive attack, a fighter is removed from play, even if it scored hits every time.",
    "The most attacks any one fighter can make against the B-17 during one wave is threeâ€”one initial and two successive attacks."
